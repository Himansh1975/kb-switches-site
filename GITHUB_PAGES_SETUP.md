# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## ⚠️ Important: Repository Settings Required

The GitHub Actions deployment requires proper GitHub Pages configuration in your repository settings.

## 📝 Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

### 1. Go to Repository Settings
1. Open your repository: https://github.com/Himansh1975/kb-switches-site
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab (top right)
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages Source
1. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
2. **DO NOT** select "Deploy from a branch" - use "GitHub Actions"

### 3. Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)
1. Under **"Custom domain"**, enter: `kbswitches.in`
2. Check **"Enforce HTTPS"** ✅
3. GitHub will verify your domain

### 4. Permissions (Critical)
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **"Workflow permissions"**, select:
   - ✅ **"Read and write permissions"**
   - ✅ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

## 🔄 After Setup is Complete:

1. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor deployment**:
   - Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
   - Watch the "Deploy KB Switches to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Should complete successfully in ~2-3 minutes

3. **Visit your site**:
   - https://kbswitches.in (custom domain)
   - OR https://himansh1975.github.io/kb-switches-site

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### If deployment still fails:
1. **Check repository permissions**: Settings → Actions → General
2. **Verify Pages source**: Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"
3. **Domain verification**: May take a few minutes for custom domain

### If build succeeds but site doesn't update:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check DNS propagation** for custom domain
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for GitHub CDN to update

## ✅ Success Indicators:

- ✅ Green checkmark in Actions tab
- ✅ Site accessible at kbswitches.in
- ✅ Mobile responsive design working
- ✅ All components loading properly

## 📞 Domain Configuration:

Your CNAME file is already configured for `kbswitches.in`. Make sure your domain's DNS settings point to:
```
CNAME: himansh1975.github.io
```

The workflow is now properly configured and should deploy automatically once repository settings are updated!
